# Description of this Project:

The group undertook the project named “LifeTracker” for the reason of creating a system that allows 
individuals to finetune their daily lifestyle. Normal calendar/tasks applications are often underused 
or not used at all due to the separation of the two. Not only this, but certain tasks do not occur at 
the standard frequencies offered by these particular applications. The team aims to create a 
comprehensive application that allows users to define their absolute needs by providing clear, 
concise prompts to the user and creates actionable items that the user can track with ease. 

In a traditional calendar, (say the Samsung Calendar application on Samsung phones), if the user 
wants to create a reminder for an oil change, they would have to create separate instances every 
service interval. With LifeTracker, the user will be able to create the instance and specify the 
interval that they want to be reminded. 

Another feature that is toted by this application is the combination of tasks in calendar view. If 
the task is a time sensitive item, it will mark itself on the calendar and treat it as both a task 
and appointment. If it just a task, the item will still populate on the calendar as a task that is 
to be completed at convenience. Repeatable routines, (such as shower, exercise, etc) are repeatable 
through each of the days specified and allow the user to develop a habit of following their own 
routine. The goal is to offer a comprehensive view of the day, week and month for the user to toggle 
through to allow the maximum amount of information required.

## Functionality for Users:
For our life tracker app, we hope to havea comprehensive amount of features that enhances the user's recurring reminders or events in their life. Functions to include are...

+ Clean UI
	+ easy to identify live timers for reminders.
	+ no distractions on the page
	+ cleaner lines
	+ visual 'loading bar' to represent time til next event occurs
+ User Profiles
	+ Store tasks for cross platform help
	+ can login on any device/machine and have tasks avaliable
+ A list of reminders of recurring tasks/events (ex. like changing air filter or scheduling appointments)
	+ Provide diverse ammount of sorting systems for tasks that fit the user's needs.
	+ Different Groupings for the tasks/events
	+ Labeling, 'urgency' listing, titling, notes, etc featured on the tasks
+ simple exporting of dates or events


## Potential Technology Systems and Frameworks:

There are a variety of frameworks and other technology systems that are
being considered for this project. The following are some examples of what this
project could potentially incorporate:

+ Database Options

	+ Locally Stored Data 

		+ SQLite

		+ Room Persistence Library (an abstraction over SQLite that
		  makes database access easier. A part of the Android Jetpack
		  suite)
	
	+ Cloud Based Storage Software (either with a third-party host or
	  locally hosted)

		+ MongoDB - a non-relational, document based, database 

		+ PostgreSQL - a SQL based relational database that has
		  integration with languages such as C or C++

		+ MariaDB (as a part of XAMPP when locally testing) - an SQL 
	          based relational database that is a fork of MySQL.

		+ MySQL (as a part of the LAMP stack) - an SQL based relational
		  database

	+ Cloud Based Services

		+ MongoDB Atlas - a cloud based non-relational database service

		+ Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) - a cloud based 
		  relational database service that offers several types of 
		  database engines

		+ DigitalOcean - provides database hosting and administration

		+ Microsoft Azure SQL Database - a managed database hosting
		  service that can use tools like machine learning to improve
	          performance 

+ Development Framework Options 

	+ Native OS Development

		+ Android Studio - an official IDE (Integrated Development
		  Environment) that supports development in languages such as
	          Kotlin, Java, C/C++, etc.

			+ This could be used in conjuction with Google Firebase
			  which is a development platform to assist in app
			  development

		+ Qt for Android - a cross-platform framework development tool
		  that uses C++ and C as it's languages

	+ Web Based Development

		+ Adobe PhoneGap - a development tool that uses web development
		  technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to form apps

		+ React Native - a development framework that uses a combination
		  of React javascript libraries and native device development

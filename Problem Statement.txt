Problem Statement for LifeTracker
The group undertook the project named “LifeTracker” for the reason of creating a system that allows 
individuals to finetune their daily lifestyle. Normal calendar/tasks applications are often underused 
or not used at all due to the separation of the two. Not only this, but certain tasks do not occur at 
the standard frequencies offered by these particular applications. The team aims to create a 
comprehensive application that allows users to define their absolute needs by providing clear, 
concise prompts to the user and creates actionable items that the user can track with ease. 

In a traditional calendar, (say the Samsung Calendar application on Samsung phones), if the user 
wants to create a reminder for an oil change, they would have to create separate instances every 
service interval. With LifeTracker, the user will be able to create the instance and specify the 
interval that they want to be reminded. 

Another feature that is toted by this application is the combination of tasks in calendar view. If 
the task is a time sensitive item, it will mark itself on the calendar and treat it as both a task 
and appointment. If it just a task, the item will still populate on the calendar as a task that is 
to be completed at convenience. Repeatable routines, (such as shower, exercise, etc) are repeatable 
through each of the days specified and allow the user to develop a habit of following their own 
routine. The goal is to offer a comprehensive view of the day, week and month for the user to toggle 
through to allow the maximum amount of information required.
